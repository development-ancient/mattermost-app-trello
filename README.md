## Install with HTTP

To install an app with HTTP method, run the command ``/apps install http TRELLO_API`` in any channel. The ``/trello`` command should be available after the configuration has been successfully installed.

The ``TRELLO_API`` should be replaced with the URL where this Trello API instance is running. Example: ``/apps install http https://myapp.com/manifest.json``

# Development environment

## Manual installation

*  Download the latest repository release in [mattermost-app-trello](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-app-trello).

### Run the local development environment

* You need to have at least Node version 15 and maximum version 18 installed. You can download the latest LTS version of Node for your operating system here: https://nodejs.org/es/download/

### Install dependencies
* Move to the project directory or execute ``cd`` command to the project directory and execute ``npm install`` with a terminal to download all dependency libraries.

```
$ npm install
```

*  Update the environment configuration file. The ``.env`` file must be modified or added to set the environment variables, it must be in the root of the repository.

```
file: .env

PORT=4005
HOST=http://localhost:4005
```

Variable definition

- PORT: The port number the OpsGenie integration is listening to.
- HOST: The Trello API usage URL.

* Finally, the project must be executed by running the following command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Or, you can use the Makefile command:

```
$ make watch
```

### Run the local development environment with Docker

* You need to have Docker installed. You can find the necessary steps to install Docker for the following operating systems:

- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

* Once you have Docker installed, run the ``make run`` command to create the API container and expose it locally or on the server, depending on the case required.

```
$ make run
```

When the container is created correctly, the API runs at ``http://127.0.0.1:4005``. If Mattermost is running on the same machine, run the following slash command in Mattermost to install the app:

```
/apps install http http://127.0.0.1:4005
```

To stop the container, run the following command:

```
$ make stop
```
