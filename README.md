This application allows you to integrate Trello with your Mattermost instance. letting you know when a new card is created, as well as getting notified about card updates. Also, allows the user to create new cards without moving from the Mattermost window.

# Feature summary

**Trello to Mattermost notifications:** Link your Mattermost channels with the Trello boards you want to see, so you and your team can get notifications about the creation and position update of each card.

**Manage card creation on Mattermost:** Create new cards from Mattermost (via modal or command), assigning the board and the list to which you want to add the card.

# Set up

The ``TRELLO_API`` should be replaced with the URL where the Trello API instance is running. Example: ``/apps install http https://myapp.com/manifest.json``

# Development environment

## Manual installation

*  Download the latest repository release.

### Run the local development environment

* You need to have installed at least node version 15 and maximum version 18. You can download the latest lts version of node for the required operating system here https://nodejs.org/es/download/

### Install dependencies
* Move to the project directory or execute ``cd`` command to the project directory and execute ``npm install`` with a terminal to download all dependency libraries.

```
$ npm install
```

*  Update the environment configuration file. The ``.env`` file must be modified or added to set the environment variables, it must be in the root of the repository.

```
file: .env

PROJECT=mattermost-app-trello
PORT=4005
HOST=http://localhost:4005
```

Variable definition

- PROJECT: In case of executing the project with Docker using the ``.build.sh`` file, this variable will be used for the name of the container
- PORT: Port number on which the OpsGenie integration is listening
- HOST: Trello API usage URL

* Finally, the project must be executed.

```
$ npm run dev
```

Or, if you would like to use the Makefile command:

```
$ make watch
```

### Run the local development environment with Docker

* You need to have Docker installed. You can find the necessary steps to install Docker for the following operating systems:

[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

* Once you have Docker installed, the next step would be to run the ``make run-server`` command to create the API container and expose it locally or on the server, depending on the case required.

```
$ make run-server
```

When the container is created correctly, the API will be running at the url http://127.0.0.1:4005. If Mattermost is running on the same machine, run this slash command in Mattermost to install the app:

```
/apps install http http://127.0.0.1:4005
```

To stop the container, execute:

```
$ make stop-server
```
